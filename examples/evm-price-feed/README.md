# EVM Price Feed

Deployments:
- [Testnet](https://testnet.explorer.seda.xyz/oracle-programs/da91e2eb7906150993cddb911569ff1fb21f2783154435fad3bcc2bac990645b)

## Overview

This Oracle Program fetches cryptocurrency prices from Binance API and returns them in a format compatible with EVM smart contracts. It supports multiple trading pairs and calculates median prices across multiple oracle nodes for consensus.

You can test this Oracle Program on testnet with the following command:

```sh
cargo post-dr evm-price-feed \[\"BTC-USDT\",\"ETH-USDT\"\] -i da91e2eb7906150993cddb911569ff1fb21f2783154435fad3bcc2bac990645b
```

## Execution Phase

### Input Format

The execution phase expects an ABI-encoded array of strings in the format:

```
["BTC-USD","ETH-USD","SOL-USD"]
```

Where each string follows the pattern `{BASE_SYMBOL}-{QUOTE_SYMBOL}`.

### Process

1. Decodes the ABI-encoded input array.
2. For each trading pair, fetches the current price from Binance API.
3. Converts prices to `u128` with 6 decimal precision.
4. Returns the prices as a JSON array.

### Example

Input: `["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"]`
Output: `[45000000000, 2800000000]` (prices in 6 decimal precision)

## Tally Phase

### Input

No additional input is required for this Oracle Program as the Tally Phase only uses the reveals from the Execution Phase.

### Process

1. Collects all price reveals from oracle nodes.
1. Calculates the median price for each trading pair.
1. ABI-encodes the result as `uint256[]` for EVM compatibility.
1. Posts the final result.

### Output Format

The result is ABI-encoded as `uint256[]` where each element represents the median price of the corresponding trading pair in the input order.

### Example
If the execution phase processed `["BTC-USD", "ETH-USD"]` and the median prices were:
- BTC-USD: $45,000.00 (45000000000 in 6 decimals)
- ETH-USD: $2,800.00 (2800000000 in 6 decimals)

The tally phase would return: `[45000000000, 2800000000]` ABI-encoded as `uint256[]`.

## Supported Trading Pairs

This oracle supports any trading pair available on Binance API.
