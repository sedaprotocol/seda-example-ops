# Simple Price Feed

Deployments:
- [Testnet](https://testnet.explorer.seda.xyz/oracle-programs/ea3860e9f537eed6b4ac4ee1c97dea0fd1b7e33a29afaa846ad29671ddaa194e)
- [Mainnet](https://mainnet.explorer.seda.xyz/oracle-programs/ae31c9c4026d259cabab6df4e012f4837175fa27572c49e313337516f971772a)

This Oracle Program gets the price of specified crypto assets in USD by leveraging the Coingecko API, and returns the price in a format compatible with EVM smart contracts. The API is behind a Data Proxy.

You can test this Oracle Program on testnet with the following command:

```sh
cargo post-dr single-price-feed BTC,ETH -i ea3860e9f537eed6b4ac4ee1c97dea0fd1b7e33a29afaa846ad29671ddaa194e
```

## Execution Phase:

### Input format

The Execution Phase expects a comma separated list of crypto symbols i.e. `BTC,ETH,etc...`

### Process

1. Get the input.
1. Makes a HTTP call to the DxFeed Data Proxy.
1. Converts the decimal to a `u128` with 6 decimal precision.
1. Returns the prices as a JSON array preserving the order the symbols were given in.

### Example

Input: `"BTC,ETH"`

Output: `[119792000000, 4300910000]` (prices in 6 decimal precision)

## Tally Phase

### Input

No additional input required - uses the reveals from the Execution Phase.

### Process

1. Collects all price reveals from oracle nodes.
1. Calculates the median price from all the given prices for each crypto symbol individually.
1. ABI-encodes the result as a `uint256` for EVM compatibility.
1. Posts the final result returning the same order of symbols given in the Execution Phase.

### Output Format

The result is ABI-encoded as `uint256` where the final number is the median of all the collected price data.

### Example

If execution phase ran with a replication factor of 2 and the prices were:
- [100, 200]
- [200, 400]

The tally phase would return `[150, 300]` ABI-encoded as a `uint256[]`.

## Supported Data

Any crypto symbol supported by the CoinGecko API.
