  SEDA Oracle Program Templates
</h1>

This oracle template demonstrates official Oracle Program use cases. If this is your first time working with SEDA and Oracle Programs, we encourage everyone to read our [docs](https://docs.seda.xyz/home/) to better understand what an Oracle Program is and how it works.

In a quick overview:
- **Oracle Program**: Is a WASM (Web Assembly) program that is uploaded to the SEDA network. This program can contain one or both of an Execution and/or Tally phase.
- **Execution Phase**: This is where the logic for what data you want onchain is written. This logic is executed by a number of executors decided by the Data Request poster.
- **Tally Phase**: This is where the logic for consolidating and choosing the best answer is written, for example, using the mean, median, or another method. This logic is executed by SEDA nodes before posting the Data Result.
- **Data Request**: A request posted onto a chain by a user that states which Oracle Program to use, the number of executors to run it, and pass the arguments to the program(s). You can choose an Oracle Program for execution and tally, and pass arguments to them separately.
- **Data Proxy**: A proxy to expose a private API to the SEDA network without leaking a private key. Calling one comes with a cost configured by the Data Proxy host.

Clink the links below to learn how to quickly post a Data Request specifically for each example, however, please check out the [requirements](#requirements) before posting a Data Request with the examples:

## Requirements

Make sure the tools below are installed and in your `PATH` if you want to build, deploy, post Oracle Programs and post Data Requests. For quick starting, the only requirements are **Bun** and **Rust**.

- **Bun**: Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management and building.
- **Rust**: Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) for development and building.
- **WASM**: Install the [`wasm32-wasip1`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/wasm32-wasip1.html) target with `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1` for WASM compilation.
- **WASM-OPT**: Can be installed via `bun/npm/etc install -g binaryren`, `cargo install binaryren`, `cargo binstall binaryren`, or your OS package manager.
- **WABT**: Can be installed via `bun/npm/etc install -g wabt`, or your OS package manager.
- **WASM-STRIP**: Can be installed via `cargo install wasm-strip`.

- Alternatively, use the [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) for a pre-configured environment.

## Getting Started

Please find a few example Oracle Programs here:

- [Blocksize Bidask](./examples/blocksize-bidask/README.md): Receives the latest aggregated bid ask for one pair from the Blocksize API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Blocksize VWAP](./examples/blocksize-vwap/README.md): Receives the latest volume weighted average price for one pair from the Blocksize API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Caplight Eod Market Price](./examples/caplight-eod-market-price/README.md): A way to ask for the market price history for a company leveraging the Caplight API behind a data proxy.
- [Equity or Commodity Price](./examples/equity-or-commodity-price/README.md): A way to get the price of a commodity or equity using the dxFeed API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Single Commodity Price](./examples/single-commodity-price/README.md): A way to get the price of a commodity using the dxFeed API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Single Equity Price](./examples/single-commodity-price/README.md): A way to get the price of an equity using the dxFeed API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Single Equity Price Verification](./examples/single-equity-price-verification/README.md)
- [Multi Price Feed](./examples/multi-price-feed/README.md): A price pair feed using the free APIs for Binance, MEXC, and OKX.
- [Single Price Feed](./examples/single-price-feed/README.md): A price feed using the pro Coingecko API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Single Price Feed Verification](./examples/single-price-feed-verification/README.md#overview)
- [EVM Price Feed](./examples/evm-price-feed/README.md): A price feed using the public Binance API, and its inputs are also EVM ABI format.
- [US Rates](./examples/us-rates/README.md): Get the prices of US Assets using the Nobi API behind a Data Proxy.
- [Kalshi Simple Feed](./examples/kalshi-simple-feed/README.md): Fetches YES bid prices for a single Kalshi prediction market with consensus pricing.
- [Kalshi Multi-Market Feed](./examples/kalshi-multi-market-feed/README.md): Fetches YES bid prices for multiple Kalshi prediction markets simultaneously.
- [Kalshi-PolyMarket VWAP](./examples/kalshi-polymarket-vwap/README.md): Calculates Volume-Weighted Average Price between Kalshi and PolyMarket for the same prediction market.

Each example can be interacted with in various ways.
In order to receive help information for them you can run:

```sh
cargo xtask --help
```

You will need to have run `bun install or cargo install-tools` to have the bun dependencies installed.

> [!NOTE]
> All commands can also be run via `cargo run <command> <options>`.
> For example, `cargo run compile single-price-feed` would work the same as `cargo compile single-price-feed`.

> ![NOTE]
> For some commands, they may require your `SEDA mnemonic`.
> This is set via an env variable, so you can also use the example [.env](.env.example) file we have here to fill it out.
> There is one for `TESTNET` and `MAINNET`.

### Building

To build one of the Oracle Programs, run the following:

```sh
cargo compile <oracle-program>
```

You can list the program names with

```sh
cargo compile --help
```

where'd you get the output:

```
Usage: xtask compile <ORACLE_PROGRAM>

Arguments:
  <ORACLE_PROGRAM>  [possible values: single-price-feed]

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

### Local Testing

You can test an Oracle Program with:

```sh
cargo test-op <oracle-program>`
```

where you can optionally pass in a test pattern:

```sh
cargo test-op <oracle-program> <test-pattern>
```

This command will compile the Oracle Program as well before testing it.

You can test all programs at once with:

```sh
cargo test-all-ops
```

### Uploading an Oracle Program

To upload an Oracle Program binary, run:

```sh
cargo deploy <oracle-program> <optional-network>
```

By default, the network defaults to `TESTNET`.

This command will compile the Oracle Program as well before uploading it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure you have all the environment variables set in `.env` file.

### Submitting a Data Request

To submit a Data Request to the SEDA network, run:

```sh
cargo post-dr <oracle-program> [oracle-program-specific-args] -i <oracle-program-id>
```

This will post a transaction and wait until there is a result.

So for example you can do:

```sh
cargo post-dr single-price-feed BTC,ETH -i 2f0c7eea6764398e1e5bf9cde27f206620a89d58b0e37f97cdb6567265c6c2b9 -r 3
```

In order to post the `single-price-feed` data request example with: the argument `BTC,ETH`, the id, and a replication factor of 3.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure you have all the environment variables set in `.env` file.

### Formatting and Linting

The TypeScript side is handled by [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/): `biome format` and `biome format fix`.

The Rust side is handled by `cargo`: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo fmt --all`.

Rust additionally has linting via `clippy` with `cargo clippy --all-features --locked -- -D warnings`.
